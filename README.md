# NestJS: The Complete Developer's Guide by Stephen Grinder<br>
Course: (https://www.udemy.com/course/nestjs-the-complete-developers-guide/) <br>
Course length: <b>19 hours and 44 minutes</b>

### About this course
NestJS is a backend framework used to create scalable and reliable APIs. It includes tools to handle just about every possible use case, from data persistence, to validation, to config management, to testing, data modeling and saving records in a simple file-based data store (built from scratch) and eventually work our way up to saving data in a production-grade SQL Lite instance.
This course follows Nest's testing recommendations, and you will write both integration and unit tests to ensure your project is working as expected. 
Typescript is used throughout this course to make sure we are writing clean and correct code.

 <br>

Here's a detailed look at what you'll get:
- Securely deploy your app to production
- Write automated integration and unit tests to make sure your code is working
- Build an authentication system from scratch to log users in
- Allow users to perform certain actions with a permissions system
- Store and retrieve data with complex queries using TypeORM
- Understand how TypeORM handles data relationships
- Write declarative code using property, method, and parameter decorators
- Master the concept of dependency injection to write reusable code
- Implement automatic validation of incoming requests
- Format outgoing response data with a custom DTO system
- Handle incoming requests and outgoing responses using Guards and Interceptors
- Segment your code into reusable Nest Modules
- Add structure to your database using migrations
